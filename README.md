## About-us

We are a small group of developers focused on patching the latest versions of Minecraft (modifying the game to allow free access without payment), and we upload each APK here.

## It is safe? üõ°

Yes, we provide safe APKs without any viruses or trojans that could harm your device or have any intention of stealing confidential information simply by installing the app. Trust us. Any results that might appear in antivirus scans of our APKs can be alarming, but they are false positives.

## What is the release-date?

We publish APKs at a faster rate than those on YouTube. In other words, within less than a day, the APKs for the latest version will be available in our repository.

## Our Goal

I'm not sure what to put here, but... enjoy it!
